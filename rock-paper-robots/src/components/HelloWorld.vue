    <h1>ROCK PAPER ROBOTS</h1>
    <p>In a world where robots have taken over, humans are merely slaves to
    the machine overlords. You spend your days completing your assigned
    tasks, supervised by robotic taskmasters. One day, you stumble upon a startling
    piece of knowledge- the robots who rule society love to play rock, paper,
    scissors. They can be easily persuaded to play with you. If you win, you will
    be excused from your scheduled task. If you lose, you must perform the task
    to continue.</p>
